		<body>
			<p>I am a wife. A sister. Daughter. Mother of Dragons. Obsessed Star Wars fan. I currently reside in Oregon but a native
			Texan. I'm very short in height which has both its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, I have started strength
			training at the gym and if I have free time, it is spent learning to code or read books. I love the color pink, macarons, 
			reptiles, whiskey, sushi, beach and naps. Oh boy do I love naps.</p>
