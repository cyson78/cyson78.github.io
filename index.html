<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>I started out with a B.A. in Speech Language Pathology because I truly felt that I had a passion
for working with kids. And I did. But it was never really satisfying. While I did beg my parents to let me
switch to comp sci, I was told that computers were not for girls. Turns out, I like software more than kids. 
I've run customer service and technical support for software companies and now my experience is in data migration
and modification as well as small time project management. Currently, I aspire to learn, be a project manager and
pick up as much code as I can. I have been a data integration analyst working with a small implementation team 
launching software for the car industry and I love every moment of it. There is so much to learn and so much 
that has not been discovered yet. This to me, is tons of fun.</p>

<p>On the side of being a student and working full time, I also try to spend time looking through open source educational classes
such as The Odin Project, Treehouse and Skillcrush. The learning is endless for me and there is plenty to do out there.
