<h3>Skills, Experience & Training</h3>
        <ul class="skills">
        <li>5 years of software industry experience ranging from job seeker application, education, automotive to hospitality industry.</li>
        <li>2 years of small team mamagement ranging from 5-20 staff members including but limited to new product launch, implementation, partnership manager, and reporting.</li>
        <li>3 years of knowledge reading/working with basic HTML, CSS, XML.</li>

<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>I am an Implementation Analyst for a software company catering to the hospitality industry. I have a Masters in Technology Management
and hold about 2.5 years in management experience for teams as small as 5 members to as large as 20 members. My leadership style is empowering
those to stand on their own two feet, to trust not just the person but their decision and to keep an open environment where mistakes are
learning experiences and discussions are welcomed. I don't believe in micro-managing or making decisions by myself. 

Everyone has their good and bad days and I believe in trusting in the person, not the resume. Everyone learns differently, works differently
and is from a different background. Being a lead is about adapting to the environment and working with it. Not around it or above it. 

Personally, I am a nerd. I play video games, watch too many Gordan Ramsay shows and love to ~try~ cooking. I have two bearded dragons
and a husband. I live in Lake, Oswego, OR just outside of downtown Portland but I am from Texas. I love to teach when I can and hope to
lecture someday at conferences and maybe do a TED talk? Technology is about learning something new everyday, finding mistakes and fixing them
and never stopping. </p>

<h3>Some More About Me: </h3>
<p><i>The biggest mistake I ever made in my life was not continuing Computer Science after high school. Why oh why
did I listen to my asian parents? This is my mistake and my regret.</i></p>
<br>
<p><b>What is the most dangerous thing I've done?</b>
Work with convicted felons.
<br>
<b>What is the most interesting thing you've done? 
It's a tie between ziplining in Haiti and traveling to Wisconsin in the middle of a polar vortex.</b>
<br>
<b>What is the funniest thing that has ever happened to you while on the phone with a customer?</b>
There are two stories that come to mind. The first is the gentleman that was being rude to one of my staff that I called back. I
wanted to see what the deal was. Turns out we caught him on a bad day and if you've ever worked in the auto industry, you 
know the end of the month is always a killer. Well, he said some not so nice things and said a word or two. Not 5 minutes later
after hanging up on me, he calls back with a very very remorseful tone. Turns out his wife was behind him, heard the way he spoke
to me, took him by the ear and forced him to call me back to apologize. I couldn't help but laugh. He was embarassed. 

The second story is while trying to implement and train a store, I was speaking with the GM and suddenly I hear her put the phone down, 
turn around and ask her security staff to "not let that weird guy in, he's the shaman from last year that did a ritual and set an avocado on fire."
She got upset that he was near the building and hung up on me. Turns out she had to shoo him away.
<br>
<b>What was the toughest thing you had to do?</b>
Firing someone is never pleasant and because I'm part robot part softy, every time someone gets fired I think - how will they pay rent?
Afford food? Feed kids? Oh I feel so bad. But I've learned that sometimes people just don't fit in well due to a variety of reasons, 
and sometimes these reasons are firable offenses. Like stealing food from the kitchen, taking credit publically for someone else's work, 
not being on time all the time, not showing up to work at all and general abuse of power amongst the staff. It's just a sad part of life 
but something I need to understand better.</p>
<br>
<p>My philosophy is, you do what makes you happy but you do the right things. Always remember to treat others the way you
would want to be treated and never ever sulk in the corner by yourself. You're not the only one that might be having
a bad day.</p>
