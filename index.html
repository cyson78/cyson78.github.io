<h1>Who am I? Why am I here?</h1>
<p>I took Computer Science in High School on a semi-dare, because no one thought I could achieve something that 
complicated. What I didn't anticipate out of that experience was that I'd actually enjoy it. 
I received a B.A. in Speech Language Pathology in December of 2008 because I thought that I was destined
to work with kids the rest of my life. Because of that one computer science course, I knew I prefered computers over
children as cute as they may be. I started out as a Customer Support/Account Manager supporting accounts post-sales
and soon moved on to a Senior Technical Support position with an educational software company resolving installation
issues, cloud support and troubleshooting something as simple as updating a roster, resetting passwords and adding
new accounts. This soon changed into an environment for the survival of the fittest as a database analyst at a software
start up in Plano in the automotive industry. Tough place to be, very challenging but worth it at the end. I decided
I needed a change and worked up the courage to take a chance on an offer that had come across my lap more than once
with a much larger, international company that caters to the hospitality industry working with hotels, hostels, bed &
breakfast, motels, you name it, we have it. While I want to say that I'm heading down the right path, I am always 
open for new adventure and looking for new challenges and a forever home where I can continue advancing my technical
skills. More coding, more challenges, tough roads to cross and new lands to discover. I'll be the first to admit, 
I'm not an expert, but I'd like to further continue my skills. This is what life is about. </p>

<p>When someone hands me a high school superlative questionnaire, it's hard to say what I'd be. I remember my high
school best friend telling me I was most likely to own the white picket fence house with grass aligned perfectly. I'm
quiet, reserved and like to keep to myself, not big on confrontation. However, I'll own it when I need to. I like to
read, listen to Steve Aoki or Skrillex, eat macarons, and on occasion go shopping if I'm in the mood. I have two bearded
dragons and 5 fish (not by choice, won them at Oktoberfest). If it were up to me, I'd like to continue educating the
world on what it is like to be a functional adult, how to survive, how to manage people and be able to grow a better
community. It is easier than watching me trying to keep a plant alive, I do not have a green thumb by any means.</p>
