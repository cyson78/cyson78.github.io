    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
    Over the past decade and a half, I’ve built a career that bridges leadership, product strategy, and data integrity across multiple industries. I like to say I’m a “data guy”
    because in this new agentic era of AI, success starts with clean, well-managed data. Currently, I serve as a Product & Training Manager at Salesforce, where I design and lead enablement and AI-readiness programs 
    that consistently outperform company benchmarks — increasing internal training attendance by 60%, boosting certification pass rates by 25%, and cutting new-hire ramp time by more than half. 
    I take pride in being a contributor who not only executes but elevates — someone who connects product, data, and enablement functions to deliver measurable business impact.
    <br></br>
    Before my time in tech, I worked in early childhood education and intervention, creating safe, inclusive classrooms that helped children of all abilities reach key milestones. 
    That foundation of empathy continues to shape how I approach customer experience today because meaningful support is what sets great companies apart.
    I’ve been recognized for going above and beyond in critical customer situations, from preventing legal escalation through clear communication to helping a remote client complete 
    a software implementation despite limited internet access. Those experiences remind me that genuine care and adaptability matter as much as technical skill.
    <br></br>
    My dedication has led to unique opportunities, including being offered a remote position in a non-remote culture long before remote work became standard practice. I bring that 
    same commitment to my community, serving as a Director on my Homeowners Association, where I help manage budgets, vendor relationships, and ensure residents enjoy the community we're building together.
