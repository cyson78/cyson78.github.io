<h3>Skills, Experience & Training</h3>

<h1>Who am I? Why am I here?</h1>
<p>I've always loved helping the customer whether I was teaching, working tech support or implementing software.
Because my undergrad is in Speech Therapy, I always felt like no one took me seriously so I went and got a very expensive 
piece of paper that cost me $30,000 but well worth it. I graduated this past December with a Masters in Technology Management 
in hopes of turning my career into something more. I love working with people, I love teaching at any and all levels
and I document like there is no tomorrow. School doesn't teach you how to socialize, how to work or be more productive
but rather, the skills to accomplish all of those things and more. My degree has taught me to love what I do and to
do it better, but I am always open to learning more. Currently, I love joining open source courses to expand my knowledge
and advocate for others to do the same. Technology doesn't stop and there are new things to learn everyday.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On the side:</h3>

<p>I'm always looking to learn. Now that I'm done with school, I would like to spend more time on open source
courses like Coursera or EdX. I want to brush up on my skills to learn more simple coding through HTML, CSS
and Javascript. I want to learn to write a blog so that maybe one day I can contribute to something like
HackerNews with all the knowledge that I have in hopes of someone finding it useful. Now is a growing
period of time for me to do what I want with my career.</p>
<p>I listen to techno or electronica music when I work because it puts me in a trance making me the most productive, or at least
I go into the most productive state. I've worked 8 hr days and I've worked 16 hr days, weekends included. I've had the pleasure
of working from home, working from the office, on a plane, in an airport and sometimes in my sleep. I'm always
up for a good challenge. I get along with pretty much everyone because I do accept people for who they are. Nobody is normal 
and I am certainly not an exception. I have two bearded dragons as pets, I enjoy Star Wars way too much and I spend
entirely too much time on Reddit when I do have time. Most of the time I won't really comment on much because sometimes, 
social media is rough. But I do comment from time to time and I love it.</p>
<p>My philosophy is, do what is best for you and do what makes you happy. Always remember to treat others the way you
would want to be treated and never ever sulk in the corner by yourself. You're not the only one that might be having
a bad day.</p>
