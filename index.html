<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi..My Name Is...</h3>

<h>Chi</h>
<h> | Find me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/chi-son/26/577/57">LinkedIn!</a></h>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
	      <p>I am an experienced software trainer with 5 years of industry experience in various aspects including education, automotive
	      and the hospitality industry. I possess 2 years of small team management experience including new product launch, implementations,
	      software training and partner/vendor relations. I have worked with various in house products to keep up with the demands of day
	      to day operations including Salesforce and Confluence/Jira for documentation purposes. I decided to put my resume online as well
	      to further my skills in basic working knowledge of HTML/CSS and hope to further my skills into Javascript as well.</p>
	      <p>On a more personal level, I have a Masters in Technology Management and on the side, work on courses through open source 
	      providers such as Coursera, Odin Project and Standard EdX to further my skills in the tech industry. I try to keep myself
	      in a constant positive environment where I encourage others to learn the industry and follow thier passion as well. I
	      like to empower people to stand on their own two feet and be able to make their own trusthworthy decisions without second
	      guessing their choices. Mistakes are made but only because we're human and discussions are always welcomed with me. I would
	      rather an individual ask questions than assume.</p>
