<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a simple ninja. I have my BA in Speech Pathology (a lot of good that did.) And now I'm working on my MA 
   in Management Information Systems. I started out working with kids, I did a bit of daycare and then taught 
   at private preschools. With my job change, it turns out I'm not really a big kid person. Worked with customer
   service at software companies, job was fun but sometimes the staff was not. No big deal, to each its own. Now,
   I'm a data integration minion at an automotive inventory management software company. Lots of new things to learn
   and discover. Tons of fun.

<p>Aside from just working, I also like to play with legos, tend to my bearded dragons, read books and roll around my house. Sometimes I play video games too on the computer. Soon I will program my sphero to take over the world. (When UPS decides to unload and deliver).</p>
