<h1>Purpose Of My Life</h1>
<p>I took Computer Science in High School on a semi-dare, because no one thought I could achieve something that 
complicated. What I didn't anticipate out of that experience was that I'd actually enjoy it. 
I received a B.A. in Speech Language Pathology in December of 08 because I thought that I was destined
to work with kids the rest of my life. Because of that one computer science course, I knew I prefered computers over
children as cute as they may be. I started out as a Customer Support/Account Manager supporting accounts post-sales
and soon moved on to a Senior Technical Support position with an educational software company resolving installation
issues, cloud support and troubleshooting something as simple as updating a roster, resetting passwords and adding
new accounts. I am currently in a Database Anaylst position catering to the automotive industry. I modify
and manipulate data, review data to ensure that it is what I need and monitor feeds, migrations and help out with 
general IT issues. I'd say that this is heading in the right path. Now I want more..more code, more challenges and 
I want to use my brain more while it is still young and fresh in my head. There is so much to learn, so many 
new skills to discover. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not expert, but I'd like to further continue my skills. 
To me, this is what keeps me going...
